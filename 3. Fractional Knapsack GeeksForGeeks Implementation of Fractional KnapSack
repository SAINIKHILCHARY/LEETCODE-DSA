Input: n = 3, w = 50, value[] = [60,100,120], weight[] = [10,20,30]

To solve the fractional knapsack problem, follow these steps:

1. Calculate Value-to-Weight Ratio: For each item, compute its value-to-weight ratio.

=> Item 1:10 = 6.0

=> Item 2: 100 = 5.0

=> Item 3:10 = 4.0

2. Sort Items: Sort items by their value-to-weight ratio in descending order.

=> Sorted order: Item 1, Item 2, Item 3.

3. Fill the Knapsack:

=> Take all of Item 1 (10 weight, 60 value).

=> Take all of Item 2 (20 weight, 100 value).

Remaining capacity: 50-30=20.

=> Take 3 of Item 3 (which gives Ã— 120 = 80 value).

4. Calculate Total Value:

=> Total value = 60+100+80= 240.
