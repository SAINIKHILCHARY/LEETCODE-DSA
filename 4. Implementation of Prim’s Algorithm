Prim's Algorithm is used to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph. Hereâ€™s a simple implementation outline:

Initialize Structures:

Create a priority queue (min-heap) to select the edge with the minimum weight.
Maintain a visited array to keep track of included vertices in the MST.
Select Starting Vertex:

Choose an arbitrary starting vertex and add it to the MST.
Update Edges:

For the selected vertex, add its adjacent edges to the priority queue.
Iterate Until MST is Complete:

While there are vertices not included in the MST:
Extract the edge with the minimum weight from the queue.
Include the corresponding vertex in the MST.
Update the priority queue with new edges from this vertex.
Result:

The resulting edges form the Minimum Spanning Tree.
